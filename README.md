# ðŸ§© Project Setup Guide

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Install Dependencies

This project has both **root-level** and **client/server** dependencies.

First, install the packages in the **root** directory (important because of the `concurrently` dependency):

```bash
npm install
```

Then, install dependencies in each subproject:
```bash
cd client
npm install


cd ../server
npm install
```


Once all dependencies are installed, start both the client and server together (from root directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Run all clients tests with (checkout client folder):
```bash
npm run test
```
